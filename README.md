<h1>Personal Website for Rishi Garg</h1>
<p>
  This is a personal website that I developed for my father, Rishi Garg, providing personal information while shedding light on his education, work experience and other achievements.

  The website utilises an intuitive user interface with features such as a background colour picker, font changer and adaptive text colouring.
